**Alpha quality** you probably only want to use this if you like to send pull requests
fixing things :)

## How it works

See [our site](http://moose-team.github.io/friends/) or the `gh-pages` branch.

## Installation

### Logging in

Friends currently uses your git + github configuration.

If you don't already have a public key on GitHub and its private key on your
machine, you'll need to [set that up
first](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/). Make sure your
github username is also set, using `git config --global user.username
yourusername`.

If this doesn't work, do this to get debug information:

```
$ npm i github-current-user -g
$ DEBUG=* github-current-user
```

and then report an [issue](https://github.com/moose-team/friends/issues).

**Note**: DSA keys are not supported. You should switch to RSA anyway for security reasons.

If it can't verify you, try doing `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Your key should show up when you run `ssh-add -l`.

### Building & Running

You'll need the newest io.js and npm (`>= 1.8.1`, `>= 2.8.3`)

* `git clone https://github.com/moose-team/friends` to get the sources
* `npm install` to install dependencies
* `npm run rebuild-leveldb` to compile leveldown for [electron](http://electron.atom.io/). you will have to modify the command in package.json if you are not on a 64-bit architecture
* `npm start` to run
* `npm run package` to build a distributable app
